    "\n",
    "A **process** is an instance of a running program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you open Chrome, a process is created.\n",
    "* When you run a Python script, a process is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each process has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its **own memory space**\n",
    "* Its **own CPU time**\n",
    "* **No direct access** to another process‚Äôs memory\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå **Think of a process as a person with their own desk, files, and tools ‚Äî they don‚Äôt share their desk with others.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßµ What is a Thread?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **thread** is a smaller unit of execution **within a process**.\n",
    "> A unit of execution is just a chunk of code (usually a function or method) that the system can run independently ‚Äî in a thread or process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A process can have **one or many threads**.\n",
    "* All threads in a process **share the same memory space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå **Think of threads as coworkers working at the same desk (the process). They can access the same files, but they might clash if they don't coordinate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Use Threads?\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Use Case: Suppose you're building a web scraper\n",

    "\n",
    "* Download 50 web pages\n",
    "* Process them\n",
    "* Save data to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "If done one by one, it could take a long time due to waiting on downloads. Instead, with **threads**, you can download multiple pages **concurrently**, making your program much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great question! To understand how **threads** relate to **cores**, we need to break this down into a few key ideas: CPU, core, thread (in programming), and how the operating system schedules them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß What is a CPU Core?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **CPU core** is a physical processing unit inside your CPU.\n",

    "* A dual-core CPU can handle **two tasks at a time**.\n",
    "* A quad-core CPU can handle **four tasks at a time**, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern CPUs often have **multiple cores** and **hyper-threading**, which we'll touch on later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßµ What is a Thread in Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **thread** is a unit of execution within a process (as discussed earlier). It's how your program does work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One **program** = one **process**\n",
    "* One process = **one or more threads**\n",

    "> **Threads are scheduled by the operating system to run on available cores.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs how it plays out:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you have 4 threads and 2 cores, the OS will run 2 threads at a time, switching between them rapidly.\n",
    "* If you have 4 threads and 4 cores, all threads can run **simultaneously** ‚Äî true parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ Time-Slicing (Context Switching)\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are **more threads than cores**, the OS uses a technique called **context switching** ‚Äî rapidly switching between threads so fast it seems like they‚Äôre all running at once. But only `n` threads (where `n = number of cores`) can run *truly in parallel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Bonus: Hyper-Threading\n",
    "\n",
    "Some CPUs can run **two threads per core** using **hyper-threading**:\n",
    "\n",

    "# üß† What is the GIL?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** is a **mutex** (mutual exclusion lock) that **prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode at the same time** in a single Python process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is **specific to CPython**, the default implementation of Python.\n",
    "* It ensures **thread safety** in the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Why does Python have a GIL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python objects like lists, dictionaries, and integers are **not thread-safe** by default. Without the GIL, two threads could modify shared memory at the same time, causing crashes or corrupt data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the GIL is a **simple solution** to make memory management safe ‚Äî especially since Python uses **reference counting** for memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üçï Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a pizza shop with **only one oven**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple chefs (threads) want to bake pizzas (run code).\n",
    "* But only **one chef can use the oven at a time** (GIL ensures one thread executes Python bytecode at a time).\n",
    "* Even if you have 4 chefs (threads) and 4 burners (CPU cores), only one can bake at any moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è What does the GIL *actually* block?\n",
    "\n",
    "It **blocks multiple threads from running Python code at once**, even on multi-core machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚úÖ **Allowed**: One thread running Python code.\n",
    "* ‚úÖ **Allowed**: Other threads doing I/O (reading files, downloading data) ‚Äî they release the GIL.\n",
    "* ‚ùå **Not allowed**: Two threads doing Python math at the same time.\n",
