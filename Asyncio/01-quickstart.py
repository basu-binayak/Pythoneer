Basic Terminology
------------------
    - async def: defines an asynchronous function (also called a coroutine)
    - await: pauses the coroutine until the awaited result is ready
    - asyncio.run(): runs the main coroutine
    - asyncio.sleep(): an async version of time.sleep() that doesnâ€™t block the whole program
