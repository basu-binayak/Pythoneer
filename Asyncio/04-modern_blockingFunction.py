Thu Mar 27 12:51:34 2025 Hello!
Thu Mar 27 12:51:35 2025 Hello from a thread!
Thu Mar 27 12:51:37 2025 Goodbye!

‚ùì So Why Does It Wait 2 Seconds After the Blocking?
-----------------------------------------------------
That‚Äôs because asyncio.to_thread(blocking) is an awaitable ‚Äî it waits for blocking() to finish in the background thread before continuing to the next line (await asyncio.sleep(2.0)).

üîÑ Think of it like this:

[ Start main() at t = 0 ]
‚Üí Print "Hello!" immediately
‚Üí Start blocking() in thread
‚Üí Wait for blocking() to finish (1 sec)
‚Üí Print "Hello from a thread!"
‚Üí Sleep for 2 seconds
‚Üí Print "Goodbye!" (at t = 3s)

NOTE:
Even though blocking() is run in a thread (so it doesn‚Äôt block the event loop), you are awaiting its result, so it still delays the next line until the blocking call completes.

If you want the blocking task to run in parallel and not await it immediately, you could create_task() around it.
